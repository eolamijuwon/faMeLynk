## Check It Out

-   Try a demo of the app on [shinyapps.io](https://gadenbuie.shinyapps.io/tweet-conf-dash/) or [my personal webpage](https://apps.garrickadenbuie.com/rstudioconf-2019/).

This dashboard is designed to provide a clean, accessible, hyper-focused interface to explore and monitor tweets sent during a conference, event, or gathering (IRL or online).

Currently, the dashboard includes the following tabs and features. The opening page show a few statistics about the current volume of tweeting about the conference. If the conference is part of a larger Twitter community, you can also display overall statistics about tweeting in that community. For example, **rstudio::conf** tweets are from members of the broader **\#rstats** Twitter community.
